## Introduction
Talk about the history of technology and mathematics and how it is used as a form of social control,
- Land Taxes based on perimeter instead of area for....... taxing land, thus being used since perimiter scales based on the square root of the area of land owned rich people pay disproportionately less land tax. [@burton_history_2011]
- This is a situation of abstract knowledge and mathematics being used to exploit people almost right after the invention of said knowledge, furthermore the tool of explotation was the mathematics itself and the fact that the lower classes had a less of an ability to understand the complex concepts





The intertwining of mathematics and other STEM fields with societal structures and power dynamics has been a persistent and complex phenomenon throughout history. This relationship often manifests in the use of these disciplines as instruments by the upper echelons of society to maintain or enhance their power, sometimes at the expense of the lower classes. This trend, visible over the last few millennia, raises critical questions about the role of scientific and mathematical knowledge in shaping economic and social inequalities.



Fast forward to the modern era, and we see the evolution of similar dynamics, albeit in more sophisticated forms. The development of neoliberal economic policies is a prime example. Neoliberalism, with its emphasis on free markets, deregulation, and privatization, has been heavily influenced by complex economic models and mathematical forecasting. While proponents argue these policies spur growth and innovation, critics point to the widening gap between the rich and the poor, suggesting that these economic theories disproportionately benefit the wealthy and powerful, often at the expense of the working and middle classes. The intricate mathematical underpinnings of neoliberal policies, not readily comprehensible to the average person, can be seen as a modern manifestation of using complex knowledge to uphold and justify systems that perpetuate inequality.

Similarly, in the realm of technology, the rise of tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Apple exemplifies how advancements in STEM can translate to immense wealth and power concentration. These companies, now integral to global economies, owe a significant part of their success to open-source software, largely developed by volunteers and available for free use. This scenario illustrates a paradox where communal and freely shared technological knowledge has inadvertently fueled vast economic disparities. The beneficiaries of this system are often those who can leverage this freely available technology to create profitable enterprises, thus raising questions about the equitable distribution of wealth generated from communal knowledge.



The evolution of mathematics and technical fields has profoundly shaped human history, often serving as tools of power and control, disproportionately benefiting the upper classes at the expense of the lower. From ancient times to the digital age, the misuse of technical knowledge illustrates a persistent theme: the exploitation of complexity and misunderstanding for profit and control.

Historically, there's evidence to suggest that mathematical knowledge was sometimes used to exploit less informed sections of society. A notable example from the ancient greece involves the misconception that the area of a rectangle was solely determined by its perimeter. This error led to various forms of deception. For instance, unscrupulous individuals in communal societies would allocate land with a greater perimeter but lesser area to others, while keeping more valuable plots for themselves. This manipulation not only resulted in material gain but also enhanced their reputations as generous and selfless, as highlighted by the Greek historian Polybius.  (see \cite{burton_history_2011}) Such instances underscore how mathematical ignorance or misunderstanding can be weaponized for personal gain.

Moving forward in time, the development of neoliberal economics serves as a modern example of this trend. Neoliberal policies, characterized by deregulation, privatization, and reduced government intervention in the economy, were often presented as universally beneficial, promising prosperity and freedom. However, in practice, these policies often resulted in increased inequality, with wealth accumulating at the top echelons of society while the lower classes faced stagnant wages and diminishing social safety nets. The technical complexity of these economic theories and their implementation allowed those in power to mask their self-serving nature, leading to widespread adoption without full public comprehension of the long-term implications.

In the realm of technology, the rise of tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Apple epitomizes the exploitation of open-source innovation for massive profit. These corporations have amassed billions by commercializing technologies initially developed by volunteers and shared freely in the spirit of open-source collaboration. This appropriation of communal efforts for private gain highlights a modern twist in the age-old story of the powerful leveraging collective knowledge to their exclusive advantage.

The advent of advanced AI algorithms and data analytics firms like Palantir further illustrates this trend. These technologies, often veiled in complexity, have been employed in predictive policing and mass surveillance, disproportionately targeting marginalized communities and stifling dissent. The use of such sophisticated tools in suppressing popular movements advocating for racial justice, climate action, and other social causes demonstrates how technical knowledge, in the hands of the few, can become a formidable instrument against the many.



Despite the historical trend of technology serving as an instrument of the powerful, it also holds immense potential for activists and community organizers. When harnessed effectively, these tools can dramatically enhance the impact and reach of grassroots movements. The rise of social media platforms, for instance, has already demonstrated this potential, enabling activists to organize and mobilize at an unprecedented scale and speed. The Arab Spring and the global Black Lives Matter movements exemplify how digital platforms can amplify voices, coordinate actions, and garner international support. Beyond communication, emerging technologies like AI and data analytics offer transformative possibilities for activism. They can be employed for more efficient resource allocation, identifying key areas of social change, and predicting the impact of various strategies. This shift from traditional methods to technology-driven approaches could revolutionize how grassroots movements operate, making them more agile and effective in their quest for social justice and equality.

Moreover, the adoption of these technologies by activists is not just about improving efficiency; it's about leveling the playing field in a landscape dominated by powerful entities that have long exploited technical advances for their own ends. By embracing AI and other advanced tools, activists can decode complex social systems, anticipate challenges, and craft more impactful strategies. This approach would represent a significant evolution in the methodology of social and political activism, moving from reactive and often improvised tactics to a more proactive, strategic framework underpinned by data and analysis.

In this research project, I will argue that the most pressing issue facing activists today is the absence of a systematic approach to evaluate the effectiveness of their actions. The crux of many social movements' struggles lies in the challenge of understanding the intricate dynamics of the societal issues they aim to address. Consequently, a significant portion of their efforts may yield limited tangible results. I posit that the remedy to this challenge lies in the adoption of new technologies, particularly AI, to model complex social systems. By leveraging these technologies, activists can gain deeper insights into the societal structures they seek to transform, predict the outcomes of various strategies, and optimize their efforts for maximum impact.



From the ancient land swindles based on geometrical misunderstandings to the modern digital age's manipulations, the throughline is clear: technical knowledge, when hoarded and wielded by the powerful, becomes a tool for perpetuating inequality and suppressing social progress. This historical pattern underscores the need for greater transparency, ethical oversight, and equitable distribution of technical knowledge to prevent its misuse as a weapon against the less privileged. Understanding this lineage of exploitation is crucial in ensuring that the advancements of the future do not repeat the inequities of the past.


## Thesis Paragraph




#### Definitions
For the sake of this essay we shall define some specific terms:

A goal is "insturmental" if it is only useful for the purpose of accomplishing another goal, for example most people do not intrinsically value money, but persue it because it is helpful for them to accomplish other goals that they might have (safety and security for themselves and people they care about, political power, or the ability to be at the top of the social hierarchy).

A goal is "intrinsic" if it is not instrumental, or if it is valued for its own sake and nothing else, some examples for most people might include happiness or spiritual enlightenment.

"Activists" are defined as "people who engage take some intentional action to advance some political goal". This is super vague and includes, anyone who makes changes to their lifestyle (vegans, etc.), employees who chose a job in government or at a green startup, politicians, NGO people, and the classic volunteer political organizer. 





## Status Quo Argument/Null Hypothesis (aka Counter Argument 0)
Counter: Even though focusing on efficacy and strategy might be important to the success of an organisation many people belive the opposite, in the papers by brigid [@grosse_colonized_2020], [@burrell_resistance_2022],  a lot of focus is put on other issues like diversity and inclusion specifically in the environmental justice orgs are the focus of the majority of the academic literature, as well as the primary focus of most of the interviews of activists, namely

In interviews [DaveR1]. [BrigidM1], [BrigidM2], [RonB1], [DevR1],[RazzG1], did not agree that these questions of efficacy were the most important issues facing the movement, ( am not claiming to have a representative sample)

Only in [KateC1] did the participant agree with the thesis.

## Direct Argument for Thesis: Efficacy is the most

Copy the argument for why activists should care more about it directly from the outline comparing activists to corporations and how that relates to their insturmental and intrinsic goals.

The intrinsic goals of any activist organizations should be the enactment of their policy objectives (even if those policy suggestions would mean the end of capitalism or the nation state), along with some ethical boundaries that one should not cross while trying to preform said tasks. 

However, its almost impossible for an NGO to measure how effective their actions are when they are actually trying to achieve that goal.

Rewrite a bunch of the analysis about bias and how activists tend to ignore conversations about efficacy in favor of other conversations. This bit is likely to be much heavier on the theory and the evidence will primarially come in the later counter counter arguments.



## Counter Argument 1: It is not about ideas, its about POWER

Counter: Dont bigger systemic factors like Support of the Elites and Greater Societal Shifts swamp the contribution of individual political strategy? See the  analysis in [@van_der_vet_activists_2023] that describes how activists need an overwhelming amount of political power to achive their goals. Papers by    [@amat_democracy_2020]

A similar line of logic is discussed in 

### Counter Counter Argument 1: What is actionable for activists?

Although many sociological studies suggest that having the support of the establishment is much more important 

Also if one first aquires powe or capital assumes that gaining it will not alter their political beliefs. There is a bunch of arguments that suggest the opposite is true, and that rich people who aquire money are statistically more likely to believe they earned that money fairly \cite{???} as well as showing less empathy to people in general (at least while driving) \cite{???}. This phenomena is well explored in (Michael Mechanic - Jackpot (2021, Simon & Schuster) - libgen.li.epub), that also discusses other problems like loosing touch with what is effective political strategy and the social pressures that push wealthy people to class segregate into groups that are more likely to have these concervative world views.

The movement of effective altruism has fallen into many of these traps according to:[@lechterman_effective_2020]. Specifically if your main forcus is to "do the most good with the money you have made" it becomes easy to justify actions like investing your money to give it away in the future. Or focusing on supposed exestensial risks like an artifical super inteligence rouge asteroid or whatever other scientific idea you find most intresting instead of helping people who are suffering right now.

Also lots of activist movements on the ground currently disagree on the assumption that political power is more important then a better strategy. This is common in circles that are more focused on organizing people and changing the political power structure itself and instead of wanting to get a specific policy goal accomplished. See these quotes from the open data people
\begin{quote}
However, some unsolved problems emerge: once the data are ‘free and reusable’, who will really be able to read them and turn them into services for citizens? Then, will these services always be equally available and free? Could an Italian citizen, well below the average of computer literacy in the advanced countries, be an active user and an autonomous interpreter in an Open Data released world?

In my opinion, the public management of information systems is undersized. As a pressure group, we need to provide political weight to a strategy in favor of a more extensive digitalization of whole the administration. 
\end{quote}
~ The Open Data Movement: Young Activists between Data Disclosure and Digital Reputation

## Counter Argument 2: Shouldnt we just wait for the revolution?
The main thing in the way of achiving a successful revolution is the fact that people arent currently signing up, in order to enact major systemic change you really only need 3.5% of the US population to actually do something.  Consider the research from (**Erica Chenoweth and Maria J. Stephan. [_Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict_](http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-15682-0/why-civil-resistance-works) (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, August 2011).**) that indicates that the most important factor behind if any movement could succeed (regardless of tactics) is that the movement can get 3.5 percent of the population to actively participate.

### Counter Counter Argument 2: Building Coallitions and Community

Consider that all of these previous movements that have ended up being successful have always been willing to innovate strategies or have occured during times of major disruption, either during situations of major technological or political change, and/or the organisers on the ground created new political strategies that have made it much more possible. 

This also connects to the section on activist burnout and how the main way of keeping activist energy high is to engage in campagins that
1. Arent wasting their time by being inneffective
2. Fufill similar social and personal goals to that of a hobby or a social group, since otherwise its almost impossible to keep the energy up for an extended period of time.

This is further expanded upon in [@wolbring_burnout_2023] and [@peterie_personal_2018] that shows a key for building successful movements is managing burnout effectively and building a supportive community for activists to engage in long term. This falls under strategy and there are potential use cases where technology could potentially have benefits for organizers.


 
## Counter Argument 3:  Are LLM's evil technology?

Counter: Papers from [@bender_dangers_2021] from google indicate that these models dispite seemingly modeling human inteligence are actually just taking phrases from their training data. Likewise this plagiarism aspect has been brought up by several academics as potentially unethical [@dwivedi_opinion_2023] in addition any controls on these large language models look like they can be easily broken as shown by [@zou_universal_2023]. This can potentially allow large governments to use it for citizen surveillance or other use cases such as bioweapon development. (Link the most recent US military report on threats of LLM's)

## Counter Counter Argument 3: Achieving revolutionary goals might require distasteful methods. (Social Media for example)


While concerns such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and misinformation are particularly prominent in discussions about LLMs, these are not unique to them. Search engines also grapple with issues of data collection and the ethical implications of their ranking algorithms, which can affect public opinion and knowledge. Similarly, digital marketplaces and platforms face scrutiny over how they handle user data, moderate content, and influence consumer behavior. The ethical landscape of these technologies is fundamentally about how they balance user benefits with potential harms, a challenge shared across the digital ecosystem. Like their digital counterparts, LLMs have the potential for tremendous social good if guided by ethical principles, emphasizing that the ethicality of a technology is less about the tool itself and more about the frameworks and regulations governing its use. 

Even the papers critical of LLMs like [@bender_dangers_2021] acknowledge this perspective.







## The scope of this problem is so big its impossible to understand

Counter: isnt saying that the key to effective activism is a much greater abundance of knowledge 








### "Activism" as a subcategory




# Bias,  Failure States and Money

I think a lot of people, and lefty types in particular, underestimate how powerful a mathematical invention money is. The ability to create a measure, even though flawed and innacurate, of the abstract value of an object holds to society. Often socialist critiques that are levied against money go something like "Money compresses all of the social, labor enviornmental networks and impacts of an object into a single real number, so much information is thrown away it renders the result completely useless." However, almost all of the power of money comes from this gross oversimplification. By condensing all of society into a real number it enables you to answer questions that would otherwise be impossible. How does society change over a time interval $t$ , given that I change these free variables $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$  what is the most efficient way to change them to maximize the value of society?  When is the maximum value of society if I can change all of those variables? All of the answers provided are always going to be wrong, but there are many situations where having a wrong answer is leages better then having no answer at all.

Why do I bring this up? Because inevitably whenever you create activist systems that attempt to exist outside of money, its absence creates inevitable and often fatal problems .

If you go out into the world today and ask any business "Are you currently in the process of loosing money or going bankrupt?" you will get a "no" from almost every single one you ask. This might seem like a bit of an obvious answer, for every successful business their exist the graves of 3-20 others that weren't able to make money and sunk. The upside of this is that all businesses make money, and that basic knowledge of how to make a profitable business (don't sell something for more then it cost to make, don't hire a bunch of employees you cant afford or don't do anything, minimize expenses wherever possible, sell product at what the market will bear while still allowing you to attract customers). Furthermore any company is going to devote a significant amount of energy to answering the question "What is the most effective way to make money?." (Most companies with a lot of revenue dedicate their most senior, skilled and highest paid people to this very task of optimizing the companies revenue). 

Consider asking this same question to anyone working on a political goal less psychopathic then  "Are you currently making substantial progress towards ($GOAL X$)?" Any honest person is going to give you an answer between a shrug and an explanation of their orgs political strategy. But even in the best case scenario you aren't even capable of getting a concrete answer.

The consequences of this are much more severe, if your political organisation fails to meet its goal the NGO police dont come knocking and say "You have failed to achieve this much positive change in the world for the amount for resources that you spent, your organisation is dead." This lack of a failure state for activist orgs means you have absolutely no idea if what they are doing is effective at all. Also since knowing if a NGO is successful in achieving its goal or not is super hard to ascertain, it means knowledge about how to build a organisation that is effective at achieving a political goal is nonexistent in the broader culture, and searching for insight is likely to lead to useful results.


## Bias Correction and Lens Flatteners

The downside of this is that any form of organisation or company is going to have a bunch of factors that push them in different directions aside fom the company/ngo's goal.  NGO's lack of quantifiable goals can make these pulling factors much more dangerous since you have almost no indication of how far they are leading you astray.  This is compounded by the fact that a lot of these biases emerge out of flaws in human psychology or other underlying cultural factors and as such tend to be unconscious. This can mean that whenever

It might seem hard to find a solution to these problems without knowing exactly what your final goal is, and then know how far your org is from an efficient solution to its problem. However a valuable partial solution for this is to note down a lot of these common biases and guess how much you thing you or your org suffers from them and make a concious effort to choose options in the opposite direction. Since you were hopefully already choosing actions that aligned with your goal, accounting for this bias should help you be more accurate in choosing said actions.

### Introspection Bias

Typically (never owned a business) in a buisness there is always going to be a tradeoff of "decide how this buisness could make more money" and "execute tasks to make more money" (long vs short term investments are talked about elsewhere). Its almost impossible to say what a good ratio of effort is between these two tasks.  Especially since there are major diminishing returns for having multiple people working on it. Although at any successful large company, vision and long term planning are going to be handled by C suite executives who are allegedly the most competent\footnote{At least as far as the investors are concerned} and experienced people at the company.

However, if you move over the political organisation space and everything is different. Not only do activists almost never engage in introspection. When they do its infrequent that they will ever touch on the efficacy of their work. There are a multitude of potential reasons for this the main one being that arguments about efficacy are the #1 dispute behind organizational death (XR America/ XR US, Our Childrens Trust Workplace Dispute, many fights in the 1960's civil rights campaign).

Not only should activist orgs of any kind be spending a comparable amount of energy on planning and vision as a comparable company, they should be spending drastically more.   Vision and planning for companies is so much easier since money makes measureing objectives extremely easy compared to questions like "How did we help stop climate change?" This is also compounded by the fact that no one really knows how to run one of these orgs effectively, so oftentimes you need to regenerate everything from scratch.

TLDR: Running an effective activist organisation is comparable in difficulty to starting a business where you have no clue what your revenue looks like every month, and your only knowledge about business is "money good"

I personally don't know a perfect solution to this in general for every use case. In my experience pretty much every single NGO or affinity group of organizers who are actively spending time doing work should be devoting more energy to questions of efficacy. The main exception to this would be people who haven't done any work in this space who spend a lot of time weighing various options\footnote{Or complaining on twitter that people are doing activism wrong}.  My recommendation to these people would be to immediately join up with some group and do activism work of any kind before asking questions about efficacy. Not only will your thoughts be way more accurate, but people will take your ideas much more seriously compared to someone on the internet who has only ever read pure theory.
 
### Schlep Bias

In an essay by paul ghram he puts forward this notion called schlep blindness 
(http://www.paulgraham.com/schlep.html). Where he describes this tendency of the human brain to unconsciously avoid complex challenges, causing us to miss out on groundbreaking ideas right in front of us. A prime example is Stripe, a payment processing platform. Despite the evident struggle with online payments for years, nobody took up the challenge due to the complications involved.  (Dealing with banks and legacy financial systems compared to software that didnt have any of those complications.) But here's the silver lining: If you're brave enough to tackle ambitious, challenging ideas, you're not only solving a significant problem but also facing lesser competition. This is because most are too intimidated by the sheer scale and complexity of the task.

This is particularly pernicious in the world of activism since those counterveiling capitalist incentives dont exist.\footnote{ https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/15/stripe-now-valued-at-50b-following-6-5b-raise/ } So often when it comes to valuble opportunities in the activism space, when picking between
1) Purchase a share in company X, research where their shareholder meetings are and sneak into said meetings with banners and photography equipment to try to cause actual disruption to the company. Continuously do this until they ramp security way up or move shareholder meetings online.
2) Put out a call on social media for a "rally" outside campaign X's headquarters, text several collegues and invite them as speakers for your event, get t-shirts, pins and a donation box. Do the action and post the result on social media with links urging people to "get involved".
Even though both of these campaigns have a similarish amount of escalation and legal consequences (both can be mitigated with de-escalation and jail support). The main reason 99% of organisations tend to do choose option 2) is because it is much less painful for organizers to pull off, and in the absence of any stakes around needing to do the most effective action their is a strong unconscious pull towards selecting option 2.

This is a bigger problem for more radical socialists, if their goal is "bring the economy under the democratic control of the people", then actually achieving that is going to involve a tremendous amount of schlep since understanding even a small part of the production process is extremely hard and painful. And figuring out ways of making that knowledge accessible enough to allow for democratic input (or building algorthimic democracy software that would be able to integrate rougher feedback) is almost impossible. But due to schlep blindness these hard steps are glossed over, so that the average socialist pathway towards effecting change looks like
1) Socialists notice a problem
2) They will politely ask or demand an authority figure/politican fix the problem
3) The politician, having no understanding about what people's main problem is, will inform an underpaid city planner to create a technical spec document.
4) The contract will go to the lowest bidding contractor who will make all the other design decisions not specified in the spec.
5) The municipality will rely on private capital to finance the project and pay them a fixed return rate of around 8% (Very good for government bonds that never default). 

### Ideology/Values Bias

% Extend thesis to when political movements will generally let their ideological values get in the way of what is the most effective policy. Lots of times progressives will never consider resorting to direct action in a situation where a policy maker made a deeply unpopular decision and would make the right one with a tiny bit more political pressure.  Likewise a lot of anarchists will spend a bunch of time

Oftentimes socialist and lefty types will point out flaws in traditional hierarchical management, namely that it is a structure of power designed to supress worker power and increase a sense of alienation from one's labor. While this is all true the main thing that hierarchical management needs to produce is for teams to effectively work on achiving a goal. (The worker opression angle can be less important then it seems since stock options are often given out to people in startups in a very similar manner to those in worker co-ops)

However since knowing how effective your org is being is an unknown and optional concern it is easy to sacrifice almost all of your efficenecy for the sake of having a slightly better democratic process. When ideally your goal should be to maximize both the democracy and effectiveness of any decision making system.


### Communication and Information Passbacks

Since companies goals are easily measured using money it allows an easy form of communication to to other companies about what problems are important to them and how they value each of them based on how much they would be willing to pay for a solution to said problem. If a company spends $X$ dollars on some solution, that means that they think that solution will enable them to make at least $X$ more money.

When applied to activists, the upshot is that the communication between groups that would be required to take a complex problem and split it up so that each org can work on a solvable piece is really hard. Namely since the most important communication between each company namely, how much does this tool contribute to solving the upstream problem, is obscured. r




### Bullshit Metrics, Size, and Fundraising 

The fact that activists will often face problems with quantification of their goals leads them to often search for other indicators of how they are achieving their goal similar to how business set key performance indicators (KPI's). However this comparison is somewhat problematic since every KPI in a business is directly correlated with revenue or some other company objective.  Furthermore activist organisations do have fail states similar to buisnesses and typically fall into 2 camps:
1. Your volunteers quit
2. You run out of money to pay full time staff

Activist organisations dont have the luxury of knowing what their main objectives are making choosing valuable 

KPI's a much more daunting prospect.  

### The Pipe Analogy




# Your eyes are bigger then your stomach

Whatever your goals are the unfortunate truth is that enacting your goals is going to require an enormous amount of power (political and/or economic) and an understanding of how to weild that power effectively. And the bigger your goal the more of both it is going to aqquire. (This ultimately leads to my main frustration of a lot of the anarchist/tankie types is that based on their beliefs you should expect them to put in the most work when it c)

Often activists see political power as the only necessary component of implementing world changing ideas and that knowledge is oftentimes less important, but I personally feel like it is almost the exact opposite. This discrepancy is mainly due to what types of movements are percived by activists, since a protest movement having institutional power is extremely rare, as a result the world is awash with protest movements that were killed due to this flaw.

However, its also helpful to look into the world of product design, where having a startup having an extremely good novel idea that people actually want is much more important then gaining the power of capital by raising VC money. For examples in the political space there are tons of examples of rich people trying and failing to

# What is Necessary

The inevitable goal would be to try to build a replacement framework that would be able to serve as a replacement in most situations

### Vast Observational Input

Any attempt to go ahead and figure out a system of replacements for the functions that money, this was also a point brought up by Kate C in an interview that aquisition of data is the biggest issue they face is specifically finding information about new fracking projects prior to them being announced more broadly. Since by the time they were announced more broadly the lobbyists had always had time to go ahead and do a bunch of backdoor lobbying to go ahead and make the actual public comment a mere formality. 

Even though a lot of this data might not be available publicly most projects of this type are subject to a bunch of regulatory scrutiny and all of these projects have a bunch of different deadlines, so its often possible to know that a project is happening much further out by just collecting data on a bunch of regulatory channels.


### Reliability Filter

Since you are interfacing with the real world and any valuble dataset you would be dealing with are likely to have some kind of unreliablity, most of the time intentional. There needs to be some system in place for filtering down what is said in documents into a representation of the facts that is "completely reliable" (at least according to spec) while not throwing away to much information.

I think this step is necessary in between the refinement and insight step since doing it before should give a big performance improvement compared to just trying to just parse the raw sentences. 

### Factual Refinement and Insight

Being able to take this verified knowledge and figure out for any given problem or query is going to be the most relavent component and return results based on that. This problem in particular benefits greatly from recent advancements in LLM's since it is possible to get a computer to "understand" these statements as of fact well as understanding the relations amongst themselves and between them and the actual query.

### Hard System Models that allow for Speculative Execution

A "hard" system is one that is roughly similar to an electric grid or other utility, these hard systems are characterized by
1. Some space of paramaters that can represent the space of possible system configurations. (For an electric grid this would be the amount of each plant built, as well as the times where they are active)
2. Some subspace of "valid" system configurations that are determined by a certain function. (An example constraint would be that the amount of electricity produced by our electric grid configuration)
3. A function that takes in any configuration of the system and outputs a relavent variable that can be used to optimise the model through gradient decent 

Modeling these using a neural network trained with real world data is due to the fact that people's lives depend on these systems working reliability, and are
